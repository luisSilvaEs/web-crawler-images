## About this

This Web Crawler was developed using following technologies:

- NodeJS
- TypesScript by using the following dependency _ts-node_
- _node-fetch_ a module to use fetch in NodeJS, nevertheless, fetch is out of the box since Node version 18
- _cheerio_ as a dependency to handle DOM data and make queries similar to jQuery

Some small fixes were made over the original for example, adding the tsconfig.json since some errors due to TS were marked.
